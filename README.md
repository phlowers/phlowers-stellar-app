## Installation
[installation process](./docs/developer_install.md)

### Development server  
Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server.  
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding  
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.  
You can also use diminutives for your block generation.  
ex:
- `ng g c component-name` for `ng generate component-name`
- `ng g s service-name` for `ng generate service service-name`

#### Build  
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

#### Running unit tests  
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

#### Running end-to-end tests  
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

#### Further help  
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
